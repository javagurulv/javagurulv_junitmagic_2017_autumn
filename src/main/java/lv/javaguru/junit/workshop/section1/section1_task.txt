Write tests and implementation code
for TaxCalculator using JUnit framework.

TaxCalculator

Simple rules (1-3):
1) Income up to 20000 is taxed at 25%
2) Income of more than 20000 is taxed at 40%
3) Income of more than 50000 is taxed at 50%

"Hard" rules (4-5):
4) Implement possibility to calculate taxes for different years
5) Send email to VID, when income is greater then 10000

Write tests first!
Tests should drive implementation!
Use Test Driven Development (TDD) approach!
After all refactor your production code and tests!
